# find-list-rate-music-app

This project is an indication of my time at Coders Lab and serves as a graduation project for Java Web Developer course. 
My objective was to create an application which would come in handy to any music enthusiast. It connects to theaudiodb.com API, stores data in MySQL database and allows its user to:
- create/log to an account;
- create their to-listen list of albums and favorite tracks;
- create notes for each album;
- rank their favorite tracks.
